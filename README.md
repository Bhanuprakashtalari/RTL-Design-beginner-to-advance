# RTL Design: From Beginner to Advanced ðŸš€

Hi there!

Thanks for visiting my RTL Design repository! Iâ€™m really excited to share my collection of Verilog code and design tips with you. As a passionate VLSI professional actively seeking roles in Design Verification, this repo is a way for me to contribute to the community and showcase my skills. ðŸŽ“

**Currently, the code is being developed and will be uploaded gradually.** Iâ€™m working on creating a range of Verilog examples, from basic to advanced, and will be posting them one by one. Hereâ€™s a sneak peek at what you can expect:

### Whatâ€™s Coming ðŸ“š

**1. Basic RTL Design**  
- Simple modules like adders, multiplexers, and basic state machines.

**2. Intermediate RTL Design**  
- Finite State Machines (FSMs), pipelining, memory elements, and bus systems.

**3. Advanced RTL Design**  
- Complex FSMs, arithmetic units, timing analysis, optimization, and verification.

**4. System-on-Chip (SoC) Design**  
- Bus architectures, IP integration, and Design for Testability (DFT).

Iâ€™m also preparing video explanations for each code example, which will be available soon on my YouTube channel. ðŸŽ¥

I hope you find this repo useful as the content grows. Feel free to check back regularly for updates, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or want to discuss potential opportunities.

Happy designing and learning! ðŸŒŸ

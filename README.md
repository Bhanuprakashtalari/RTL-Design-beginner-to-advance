# RTL Design: From Beginner to Advanced ðŸš€

Hi there!

Thanks for visiting my RTL Design repository! Iâ€™m really excited to share my collection of Verilog code and design tips with you. As someone passionate about VLSI and actively seeking roles in Design Verification, this is a great way for me to contribute to the community and showcase my skills. ðŸŽ“

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find in this repo:

### Whatâ€™s Inside ðŸ“š

**1. Basic RTL Design**  
- Simple modules like adders, multiplexers, and basic state machines.

**2. Intermediate RTL Design**  
- Finite State Machines (FSMs), pipelining, memory elements, and bus systems.

**3. Advanced RTL Design**  
- Complex FSMs, arithmetic units, timing analysis, optimization, and verification.

**4. System-on-Chip (SoC) Design**  
- Bus architectures, IP integration, and Design for Testability (DFT).

Iâ€™m also working on adding video explanations for each code example, which will be available soon on my YouTube channel. ðŸŽ¥

I hope you find this repo helpful, whether youâ€™re learning or just exploring. If you have any questions or want to discuss potential opportunities, feel free to reach out.

Happy designing and learning! ðŸŒŸ
